# TKPEngine

## the worlds worst game engine

its bad...

but if you want more details on it for some reason...

its written in c99 using OpenGL for now.

it has a custom module system simular to godot's where custom modules are located in the modules folder, and are dynamically compiled into the executable.

it also has a component system close to unity's. however it may be slow, as it hasn't been tested for speed yet

it also has a systems feature which utilizes modules so that multiple implementations of systems can exist without issues

# THE ENGINE IS NOT USABLE YET, AND PROBABLY WON'T BE FOR A LONG TIME
